## Acknowledgement

This repository is designed to refactor the [sensor-server](https://github.com/qhdong/sensor-server) library written by Mr. Qihong Dong. Some of the libraries used by [sensor-server](https://github.com/qhdong/sensor-server) have not been mantained for a long time, which make it difficult to run that program properly. For the convenience of latecomers and the inheritance of the laboratory, the basic functions are refactored with [Koa2](https://koajs.com/). This repository is only available to researchers of Lab 6316 of Southeast University in principle. For other requirements, please contact [Yubo Song](mailto:songyubo@seu.edu.cn) or [Rui Song](mailto:songrui@seu.edu.cn). Thank you for your cooperation.
